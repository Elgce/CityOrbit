"""Observation returned by the environment.

The observations are stored in a dictionary. The keys are the group to which the observations belong.
This is useful for various setups such as reinforcement learning with asymmetric actor-critic or
multi-agent learning. For non-learning paradigms, this may include observations for different components
of a system.

Within each group, the observations can be stored either as a dictionary with keys as the names of each
observation term in the group, or a single tensor obtained from concatenating all the observation terms.
For example, for asymmetric actor-critic, the observation for the actor and the critic can be accessed
using the keys ``"policy"`` and ``"critic"`` respectively.

Note:
    By default, most learning frameworks deal with default and privileged observations in different ways.
    This handling must be taken care of by the wrapper around the :class:`RLTaskEnv` instance.

    For included frameworks (RSL-RL, RL-Games, skrl), the observations must have the key "policy". In case,
    the key "critic" is also present, then the critic observations are taken from the "critic" group.
    Otherwise, they are the same as the "policy" group.

class BaseEnv:
    """The base environment encapsulates the simulation scene and the environment managers.

    While a simulation scene or world comprises of different components such as the robots, objects,
    and sensors (cameras, lidars, etc.), the environment is a higher level abstraction
    that provides an interface for interacting with the simulation. The environment is comprised of
    the following components:

    * **Scene**: The scene manager that creates and manages the virtual world in which the robot operates.
      This includes defining the robot, static and dynamic objects, sensors, etc.
    * **Observation Manager**: The observation manager that generates observations from the current simulation
      state and the data gathered from the sensors. These observations may include privileged information
      that is not available to the robot in the real world. Additionally, user-defined terms can be added
      to process the observations and generate custom observations. For example, using a network to embed
      high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional space.
    * **Action Manager**: The action manager that processes the raw actions sent to the environment and
      converts them to low-level commands that are sent to the simulation. It can be configured to accept
      raw actions at different levels of abstraction. For example, in case of a robotic arm, the raw actions
      can be joint torques, joint positions, or end-effector poses. Similarly for a mobile base, it can be
      the joint torques, or the desired velocity of the floating base.
    * **Randomization Manager**: The randomization manager that randomizes different elements in the scene.
      This includes resetting the scene to a default state or randomize the scene at different intervals
      of time. The randomization manager can be configured to randomize different elements of the scene
      such as the masses of objects, friction coefficients, or apply random pushes to the robot.

    The environment provides a unified interface for interacting with the simulation. However, it does not
    include task-specific quantities such as the reward function, or the termination conditions. These
    quantities are often specific to defining Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while the base environment
    is agnostic to the MDP definition.

    The environment steps forward in time at a fixed time-step. The physics simulation is decimated at a
    lower time-step. This is to ensure that the simulation is stable. These two time-steps can be configured
    independently using the :attr:`BaseEnvCfg.decimation` (number of simulation steps per environment step)
    and the :attr:`BaseEnvCfg.sim.dt` (physics time-step) parameters. Based on these parameters, the
    environment time-step is computed as the product of the two. The two time-steps can be obtained by
    querying the :attr:`physics_dt` and the :attr:`step_dt` properties respectively.
